Blipweb is a simple web app for creating and sharing patches for MeeBlip anode
using the Web MIDI API, which is currently only supported by Chrome.

To create patches, select the a) MIDI port your MeeBlip is connected to and
b) MIDI channel your MeeBlip is configured to use.

Change the knobs and switches and press "send to meeblip" for your changes to take effect.
(Make sure you've got the right port and channel selected!)

To save your patch click "get patch link".  You can save the link to a bookmarks folder
or put it in a web page.  In this way you can create shareable libraries of patches for
your MeeBlip.

Patches can also serve as a reference guide for creating sounds on your MeeBlip.  For example,
if you load a patch link you can position the tactile knobs and switches on your MeeBlip to
mirror those in the patch config to dial in the sound of a patch config on your synth.

Note that the resonance control is not supported as it's analog only.

There are also a few MIDI only parameters that I have not implemented yet.

Nonetheless, this version has been tested on my local system and works well.  You can try out the
latest stable version at http://factotumo.com/blipweb/.

Feedback welcome.
